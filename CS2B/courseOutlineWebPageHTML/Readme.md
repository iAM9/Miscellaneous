This was a short project, intended as an intro tutorial to html.

The objective was to create a set of webpages, where each webpage consisted of the course contents of a specific subject in our study program, and then link them all together.

In short, create a "website" that displays our 4year Bachelor program's course, and clicking on a course subject link will display its contents in a web-page.
